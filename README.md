# Titanic Dataset From Kaggle
## Goal
This repositery is aimed at comparing multiple ML models performances on a Classification problem namely the prediction of survival of passengers on the Titanic
## Roadmap
# EDA and visualization
We first perform simple EDA, analyzing the joint distributions of variables in the dataset. Then we compute the correlations among the dataset.
# Features engineering
# Models testing
# Ensemble
